* the thing that show/hides a filter needs to be smarter; e.g. show a filter based on the response to multiple other filters
* put the rest of the crabs in
* put the identifying features of each crab in the data
* some way to view crab details -> popup more info
* some way to compare crabs
* ability to just show all filters
* add more filters ... ?
* some sort of reset/clear to restore all fields
* can a crab have multiple values for filter option, e.g. both round and square. It's an array, but does it work?
