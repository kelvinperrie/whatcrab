## What's my crab.

This is a proof of concept to allow people with limited knowledge of crabs to be able to identify a crab. It uses a filtering system to narrow down the species based on a set of questions and answers. The crabs are assigned attributes and the user is asked questions in (hopefully) easily accessible language; based on the answers the possible matches of crabs are filtered down.

Here is the preview (works in Chrome, don't think it works in IE):

Things to do:
* put the sources in at the crab details level; can i reference individual pages in a pdf?
* tiles that get bigger if less crabs in the results
* some way to open the raw picture full size
* some filters should be hidden if they become not possible - for example if halfcrab is selected the pillbox crab filter should hide
